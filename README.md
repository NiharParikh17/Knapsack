# Knapsack
**Objective:** Implement an algorithm that uses the two design techniques, dynamic programming and backtracking, to solve the Knapsack Problem. Analyze and compare their run times.</br>
**Course:** CS366 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

## To run the program:
**1.** You need to supply a data file named knapsack.txt at root of the project.
**2.** The file should contain **integer** item sizes, one per line, for the knapsack. The data may contain multiple items of the same size.
